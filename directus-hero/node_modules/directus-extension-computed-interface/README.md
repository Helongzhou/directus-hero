# Introduction
A [Directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) extension for automatically calculating the value of a field based on other fields of the same item, on the client side.

- **Support templating, arithmetic operations**. Concat strings, sum, subtract, multiply, modulo, convert to slug, currency, etc.
- **Can be used as an alias field**.
- **Calculation is performed on the client side**, so it would not work if the item is created/updated via direct API calls or hooks.
- **Lightweight**. No third-party libraries.

# Installation
```
npm i directus-extension-computed-interface
```

# Get Started
1. Go to **Settings**, create a new field with type string or number.
2. In the **Interface** panel, choose **Computed** interface. There are 2 options:
    1. **Template**: Similar to M2M interface, determine how the field is calculated. Learn more about syntax in the next section.
    2. **Field Mode**: Choose how the value is displayed.
        - **null**: Default option. Show an input with the computed value but still allow manual editing.
        - **Display Only**: Show the computed value but will not save it to the database. Usually used for alias fields.
        - **Read Only**: Show an input with the computed value and disallow manual editing.
    3. **Prefix**: a string to prefix the computed value.
    4. **Suffix**: a string to suffix the computed value.
    5. **Custom CSS**: an object for inline style binding. Only works with **Display Only** and **Read Only** mode. You can use this option to customize the appearance of the computed value such as font size, color, etc.

# Syntax

The template consists of 2 elements: plain strings & expressions.
- Plain strings are string literal, often used for text interpolation.
- Expressions can contains operators, other fields & numbers. They must be enclosed by `{{` and `}}`.

## Examples
Sum 2 numbers:
```
{{ SUM(a, b) }}
```

Multiply 2 numbers:
```
{{ MULTIPLY(a, b) }}
```

Convert string to slug:
```
{{ SLUG(title) }}
```

Text interpolation:
```
/{{ SLUG(title) }}-{{ id }}
```

Complex calculation:
```
{{ SUM(MULTIPLY(2, x), b) }}
```

### Relational

Operator | Description
--- | ---
`ASUM(a, b)` | Aggregated sum of O2M field. For example: calculate shopping cart total price with `ASUM(products, MULTIPLY(price, quantity))` where `products` is the O2M field in the shopping cart and `price` & `quantity` are 2 fields of `products`.

### Condition

Operator | Description
--- | ---
`IF(A, B, C)` | return `B` if `A` is `true`, otherwise `C`

## Dynamic Variables

There are 2 dynamic variables available that you can use in the expressions:
- `$NOW`: return the current Date object. Example: `{{ YEAR($NOW) }}` returns the current year.
- `$CURRENT_USER`: return the current user's id. Example: `{{ EQUAL($CURRENT_USER, user) }}` checks if the `user` field is the current user.


# Limitation
- Cannot parse literal strings (`{{ 's' }}`).
